=================
An IoT clock that orders pizza. 

Hackathon submission video: https://vimeo.com/119480238

This was created at an intel edison hackathon over the course of 48 hours. Pizza time currently has three apps. 

* The pizza time app which hooks into Domino's api to order cheese or pepperoni pizza from the closest location. 
* A simple clock app.
* A demo app that shows how to construct a simple app for the clock. 

This is currently a work in progress and contributions are strongly encouraged.
